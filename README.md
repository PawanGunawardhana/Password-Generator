# Password-Generator
This is a simple C program that serves as a password generator, creating strong and random passwords of a specified length. The program uses the standard C library functions and the rand() function to produce passwords containing a mix of printable ASCII characters.
The generated passwords are randomly generated, making them difficult to predict. However, for more secure applications, it is recommended to use a stronger random number generator or password manager.
